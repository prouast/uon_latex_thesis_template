This is the template I used to write my confirmation report and my PhD thesis at The University of Newcastle.

If you are considering to use it, please check with your advisor, faculty or school whether it is appropriate, as they may have different and/or changed rules.

I have modified these files from [Ademir Gabardo](https://github.com/agabardo/uon_latex_thesis_template), whose version in turn was based on the work by [Mikhail V. Konnik](http://www.mvkonnik.info/p/latex-template-for-phd-thesis-in.html) and a template [Monash University](http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/software/latex/).
